I am an Assistant Professor in the Division of Bioinformatics and Computational Biology in the Department of
Medical Informatics and Clinical Epidemiology at OHSU ([BCB/DMICE](http://www.ohsu.edu/xd/education/schools/school-of-medicine/departments/clinical-departments/dmice/educational-programs/dmice-programs/computational-biology.cfm)) and a member of the [OHSU Knight Cancer Institute](http://www.ohsu.edu/xd/health/services/cancer/). My research focus is on the Systems Biology of Complex Diseases. I use integrative modeling approaches across OMICs types to achieve this.

Collaboration, training and team science are passions of mine. I believe that research should not be a lonely practice, and building communities of practice in science and research that are psychologically safe and inclusive are the key to doing better, more robust science. 

To this order, I have participated in The Carpentries, Mozilla Open Leaders (through a MiniWOW), rOpenSci, RStudio Education, and have learned an amazing amount of about ways to collaborate and be inclusive through this involvement. I try and put my money where my mouth is, and have co-founded [BioData Club](https://biodata-club.github.io) (a community focused on democratizing data science skills) and [Cascadia-R](https://cascadiarconf.com) (the first Pacific Northwest regional R conference). 

My free [Ready for R course](https://ready4r.netilfy.app) currently is at over 1000 external users, and I have built a learning community around it. Feedback has been that the course has been inclusive and less intimidating for users than other R courses Our [Data Analytics](https://laderast.github.io/AnalyticsCourse) course recently won an award (Sakai Torchbearer Award) from multiple student nominations.
