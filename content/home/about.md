I am an Assistant Professor in the Division of Bioinformatics and Computational Biology in the Department of
Medical Informatics and Clinical Epidemiology at OHSU ([BCB/DMICE](http://www.ohsu.edu/xd/education/schools/school-of-medicine/departments/clinical-departments/dmice/educational-programs/dmice-programs/computational-biology.cfm)) and a member of the [OHSU Knight Cancer Institute](http://www.ohsu.edu/xd/health/services/cancer/). My research focus is on the Systems Biology of Complex Diseases. I use integrative modeling approaches across OMICs types to achieve this.

With over sixteen years of bioinformatics experience, I have developed methods for low-level preprocessing and high-level analysis of many OMICs types, including expression (especially alternative splicing), phosphoproteomics, proteomics, and genomics. My experience in functional genomics has led me to use models such as Graphical Models and Networks to integrate these many OMICs types into building a unified picture of integrated systems-level dysregulation in complex diseases such as alcoholism and cancer.

I am also actively involved in teaching and utilizing interactive visualization, especially in the analysis of high-dimensional mass cytometry data.
