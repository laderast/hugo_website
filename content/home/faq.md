## What are your priorities?

In order, they are:

1. My mental and physical health
2. My students
3. Open Science and creating a positive working environment for myself and others
4. Making and promoting new educational resources
5. Enabling better research practices

## What do I need to know about working with you?

I am clinically depressed and have anxiety, but I am high-functioning. I do my best to meet deadlines, but sometimes there is a lot on my plate and I need to manage my anxiety and depression. 

The number one thing to know is that *last minute deadlines* are a significant stress on my anxiety and affect me very negatively. I realize that this is the more often the case than not with grant deadlines, but the sooner you can ask for something before its deadline, the better.

These are hard deadlines for collaborating with me:

- 1 week notice (at least): Minor edits on figures
- 2 week notice (at least): New Figures based on existing data analysis
- 4 weeks notice (at least): New analysis based on your data that I haven't seen.

If you don't like these deadlines, there are other people out there who will probably work with you.

I do best when there is mutual respect between me and my collaborators. Good collaborations take time and I have to learn to trust working with you.

## I'm a Student and I want to work with you. How can I do this?

Email me and we'll set up an appointment to talk. If you are interested in what I'm interested in (see above), I will see if we can set up some sort of internship. 

## I'd like to collaborate with you on a project

Email me and we'll set up a time to talk. Note that I have been burned pretty badly in the past, so our goals have to align or we might have to negotiate a contract and scope of work. 

## What if I really need things at the last minute?

You get one of these a year. I'll print you a coupon. You cannot get more. I value my own mental health more than responding on the weekends. Be respectful. 

Please do not try to send me an appointment for the current time and expect to talk. I'm not going to respond. I feel this is disrespectful, and I don't have the patience or energy to do so.
