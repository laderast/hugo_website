## Current Courses I teach at OHSU and PSU

I teach in the summer hybrid [*BMI569/669 Data Analytics*](http://www.ohsu.edu/xd/education/schools/school-of-medicine/departments/clinical-departments/dmice/current-students/student-resources/upload/BMI-569_669-Data-Analytics-Syllabus-SU16-2.pdf) course at OHSU (Hybrid course co-taught with Kaiser Permanente Data & Information Management Enhancement (DIME) group). This is a super fun course for me to teach and it focuses on both organizational behavior and communicating analytic results. It is a great blend of practical soft skills in communication and hard analytic skills.

I am a co-instructor for our [*Clinical Data Wrangling short course*](https://laderast.github.io/clinical_data_wrangling/) along with Eilis Boudreau and Nicole Weiskopf. This is an optional workshop for our students (more info at the link), developed as part of our NLM T15 Data Science Supplement.

I am a co-instructor for *BMI535/635 Management and Processing of Large Scale Data *, Winter quarter 2019.

I am also a co-instructor for [*BMI551/651 Bioinformatics and Computational Biology II: Statistical Methods*](http://www.ohsu.edu/xd/education/schools/school-of-medicine/departments/clinical-departments/dmice/current-students/student-resources/upload/BMI-551-Syllabus-WI16.pdf), providing drop-in sessions for R programming and general tutoring.

I was course co-director for  [HSMP410/PHE427 Introduction to Health Informatics](https://laderast.github.io/PHE427/) at Portland State University. Spring Quarter, 2017-2018.

## Other Teaching Interests

+ I am an [RStudio Certified Instructor in the tidyverse and Shiny](https://rstudio-trainers.netlify.com/). I'm happy to consult with groups wanting to think about building a training program in RStudio/R for their group.
+ I am also a Certified Instructor for [the Carpentries](https://carpentries.org/), a volunteer based group that trains researchers in computing skills and have contributed to lesson materials there.
+ [BioData Club](http://biodata-club.github.io) - I am a co-founder and faculty co-advisor (along with Robin Champieux) for a student and postdoc driven discussion group at OHSU that focuses on practical skills (documentation, software engineering and visualization) necessary for success in data science and bioinformatics.
+ I am now a co-organizer for the [PDX R User Group](https://www.meetup.com/portland-r-user-group/) and I was one of the organizers of the first [Cascadia R conference](https://cascadiarconf.com).
