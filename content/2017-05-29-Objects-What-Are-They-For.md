One area of programming that we do a really bad job teaching is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). I was talking with one of my colleagues and he admitted that we don't have enough time in our programming course (which is not CS) to show students what OOP is, much less what it's for!

I usually find the examples that we teach in OOP to be rather useless to actually understanding what they're for. 

I'm going to talk about one reason to use Object Oriented Programming: to ensure data integrity in a Shiny App. Hopefully once you understand how I've applied the concepts here, you will start to think of other ways to apply them in your programming.

As most of you know, a Shiny App consists of two pieces: a User Interface piece, and a Server-side piece. 

I finally understood why we encapsulate data in objects.
