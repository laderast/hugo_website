Way back in high school and college, I used to be a fairly avid jazz musician. I always loved the group aspect of Jazz - in a good group, there is this sense of support for each other's creativity where everyone is backing each other up and giving each other musical space to express themselves.

My background in improvisation has served me well, in that it has enabled a lot of my musical collaborations. My music is different in that I play improvisational cello, though on a very slow scale. But you can drop me into a lot of situations and I can come up with something that will work with someone else's musical style.

I now realize that I use a lot of the rules of improvisation when I collaborate with others in Open Science.

1) Being respectful and listening. 
1) Saying "Yes, and". This is an old comedy improv rule. It means that you don't shut other people's performances down. You try to build on theirs and enhance it. I like to build on people's ideas.
1) Being flexible. See previous two rules. 
1) Don't hog the spotlight. 
1) Most things are a process and rely on previous experience. No one became an expert improviser overnight.
1) Trust the process when you can.
1) Help each other.
