**EDUCATION**

PhD, Biomedical Informatics, Oregon Health & Science University, 2014.

**RESEARCH STATEMENT**

My research interests are complex diseases, precision medicine,
applications of systems science (including network analysis and
modeling), and applying data integration to difficult and high-impact
translational research questions. These questions include immune system
profiling in both infectious disease (tuberculosis) and Acute Myeloid Leukemia,
understanding drug sensitivity in the context of multiple cancer types
(AML, Colorectal, Breast and Head and Neck Cancer), and quantifying
expression differences in alcoholic preference. I have worked with a
large number of datatypes (high-throughput immunophenotyping,
proteomics, expression, genomic, and functional drug screen data) and
have focused on methods and frameworks integrating these datatypes
within the biological and clinical context of these translational
research questions. My training in biomedical informatics as a master’s
student in Biomedical Informatics, as an NLM Predoctoral Fellow, and as
a NLM Postdoctoral fellow has enabled me to communicate with a wide
variety of collaborators by giving me a strong background in Cancer
Biology, Software Development, and Clinical Systems. Additionally, I am
a strong advocate for Open Science initiatives, most notably the effort
for reproducibility in scientific analysis. To this end, I have
developed multiple novel software pipelines that transparently process
data from raw data to through the final stages of analysis.

**TEACHING STATEMENT**

Effective communication, hands-on learning, and mentoring are core to my
teaching philosophy. I am a strong believer in enabling students in
self-directed learning through hands-on workshops including both
practical skills in bioinformatics (software development, design, and
data analysis and visualization) and social skills essential to
collaboration (interpretation and communication). In terms of practical
skills, I have developed and contributed to a number of courses
(Analytics, RBootcamp, Network Analysis, and BD2K skills courses) and
workshops in a large variety of software development and communication
topics. These topics include software design, interactive visualization,
exploratory data analysis, and presentation of results. In terms of
fostering social and collaborative skills in students, I am a founder
and co-leader of [BioData-Club](https://biodata-club.github.io), a collaborative
forum for students and postdocs to share and
teach each other practical skills for success in a research environment.
Through BioDSP, I have informally mentored a number of students through
feedback and collaboration on workshops and presentations. I believe
that by "training the trainers", we can more effectively educate
students in these skills in Data Science and Analytics. In order to
accomplish this training of trainers, my course materials are openly
available for use and modification by other teachers. Because of my
dedication to teaching and incorporation of student feedback, I have
consistently high ratings from students in terms of teaching both
long-form courses and short-term workshops.

**SERVICE STATEMENT**

I am a strong supporter of service at OHSU and beyond. I currently
participate in the DMICE BCB (Bioinformatics and Computational Biology)
Faculty Division meeting, the DMICE Mentoring committee, and have
participated in the BCB Curriculum Retreat in order to plan upcoming
coursework at DMICE. As a Pacific Islander, I have a unique viewpoint
about diversity and I hope to enhance equal opportunity by participating
in OHSU’s Diversity Advisory Council (DAC). Beyond OHSU, I believe that
we need to increase public engagement of science and increase outreach
and mentoring of next-generation science students, especially from
disadvantaged populations will enable these students to succeed in
STEM-based careers. As a former student of Saturday Academy's scientific
mentoring program, I want to contribute back to this community and
engage potential STEM students through student outreach and mentoring. I
am also involved in outreach through the development of course material
for the Biocatalyst training program through Oregon Bioscience
Association, which provides bioscience training for unemployed or
under-employed professionals.

*Tumor intrinsic and microenvironmental mechanisms driving drug combination efficacy and resistance in AML*. Most patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) eventually die when their disease becomes resistant to conventional or even newer treatments. Our proposed studies will shed light on the mechanisms of drug resistance, both within the tumor and in the surrounding environment. This knowledge will help identify more effective therapies — involving combinations of two drugs — that will avoid drug resistance and provide better outcomes for patients with AML. Role: Computational Biologist.

*Beat AML: Precision Medicine for AML Based on Functional Genomics*. The major goals of this project is to transform our approach to AML treatment through a deeper understanding of the diversity of the underlying molecular causes of disease and to bring targeted therapies to AML patients through 1) understanding the spectrum of genetic lesions and molecular drivers, 2) functionally annotating drug sensitivity, and 3) Initiating clinical trials with combinations of drugs in refractory patients. Role: Computational Biologist.
