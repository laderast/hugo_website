      <p>Hi Everyone, our paper called <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/12/12/232611"><em>Teaching data science fundamentals through realistic synthetic clinical cardiovascular data</em></a> is now available to read on Biorxiv.</p>

<p>In this paper, we talk about a dataset that we synthesized for teaching aspects of clinical data that may be tricky to understand in data science. This dataset is interesting because it&rsquo;s derived from a multivariate distribution based on real patient data, modeled as a Bayesian Network. Even when we knew true marginals for the real data, there was a lot of fine tuning to the Bayesian Network.</p>

<p>We&rsquo;ve used this dataset for a couple of classes, and we&rsquo;ve found that it helps highlight real issues in predictive modeling of clinical data. One of the largest is that most predictive models are based on a much older patient cohort (50+), which means that we don&rsquo;t know much about how to predict cardiovascular risk in younger patients. Part of the teaching exercise is having the students choose a cohort of interest and then attempt to predict on that patient cohort.</p>

<p>The data is currently available as an R package here, including vignettes about how the data was generated: <a href="https://github.com/laderast/cvdRiskData">https://github.com/laderast/cvdRiskData</a></p>
