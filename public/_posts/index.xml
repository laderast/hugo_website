      <title>Understanding Tidy Evaluation in R</title>

      <description>Have you ever had something that no matter how many times someone explained it, you really had no idea what it was for? For me, that was Non Standard Evaluation (NSE) in R, and tidyeval. I had a real learning block about it.
A quosure and an enquosure can be thought of different kinds of envelopes around an object. They obscure certain properties of the object until they can be delivered into a function.</description>

      <title>Using Synthetic Data for Teaching Data Science</title>

      <description>Hi Everyone, our paper called Teaching data science fundamentals through realistic synthetic clinical cardiovascular data is now available to read on Biorxiv.
In this paper, we talk about a dataset that we synthesized for teaching aspects of clinical data that may be tricky to understand in data science. This dataset is interesting because it&amp;rsquo;s derived from a multivariate distribution based on real patient data, modeled as a Bayesian Network. Even when we knew true marginals for the real data, there was a lot of fine tuning to the Bayesian Network.</description>

      <title>Notes on Open Data Science Conference West 2017</title>

      <description>I just came back from the Open Data Science Conference (ODSC) in San Francisco and I found it really stimulating and interesting. I learned a ton, met some great people working in very different fields, and overall found it quite worthwhile.
Here are some of the highlights from my notes:
Workshops scikit-learn intro Workshop and Advanced
I admit that I am not really a Python person. But I am helping to develop some materials for an introductory workshop and I found this workshop and its materials to be a very beginner-friendly to scikit-learn and machine learning concepts, much like caret for R.</description>

      <title>On the Separation of Code and State</title>

      <description>One of the hardest concepts as an analyst that I have struggled with is separating my code from my data. A related issue is making your code reproducible across data instances.</description>

      <title>How to Not Be Afraid of Your Data</title>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m going to be giving a talk for the PDX RLang Meetup on July 11 called &amp;ldquo;How to Not Be Afraid of Your Data: Teaching EDA using Shiny&amp;rdquo;. Abstract below.
Many graduate students in the basic sciences are afraid of data exploration and cleaning, which can greatly impact their downstream analysis results. By using a synthetic dataset, some simple dplyr commands, and a shiny dashboard, we teach graduate students how to explore their data and how to handle issues that can arise (missing values, differences in units).</description>

      <title>Some Lessons We Learned Running Cascadia-R</title>
      <link>/2017/06/07/cascadiarnotes/</link>

      <description>Well, the first Cascadia R Conference has come and gone. I have to say that it was super fun, and well attended (over 190 people!). I had a blast meeting and chatting with everyone. Hopefully, we showed newbies that R is learnable and others that there are lots more things to learn about R.
The following is my attempt to document what we learned from organizing Cascadia-R. It&amp;rsquo;s not complete; I may add and subtract from it as I think of more things to say about the planning process.</description>

      <title>On Breadth and Depth in Your Academic Career</title>
      <link>/2017/04/19/breadth-and-depth/</link>

      <guid>/2017/04/19/breadth-and-depth/</guid>
      <description>I was talking with a student and they were complaining that when at conferences, they would try to inject other topics of interest (such as cooking) into discussions with colleagues. Unfortunately, one of the after effects of this was that they were looked at as &amp;ldquo;not a serious scientist&amp;rdquo;. There&amp;rsquo;s an expectation that a scientist must be all depth, only talking and thinking about their sub-field.
As a cross disciplinarian, I have to say that is hogwash.</description>

      <title>Fostering a Peer Mentoring Culture</title>

      <description>I realize that it has been an embarrasingly long time since I updated this blog. I had all sorts of grandiose plans for it, and I think my problem was that I was thinking too broad, too pie-in-the-sky. I&amp;rsquo;m going to try to focus on short and informative blog posts.
One of the things that I have been thinking about graduate school is the idea of building a Peer Mentoring culture in our department.</description>

      <title>Surrogate Oncogene Paper is Published</title>
      <link>/2015/12/23/surrogate-oncogene-paper/</link>

      <guid>/2015/12/23/surrogate-oncogene-paper/</guid>
      <description>My dissertation paper, A Network-Based Model of Oncogenic Collaboration for Prediction of Drug Sensitivity is now published! Here&amp;rsquo;s a lay summary:
 One outstanding issue in analyzing genomics in the context of personalized medicine is the incorporation of rare or infrequent genetic alterations (copy number alterations and somatic mutations) that are observed in individual &amp;gt; patients. We hypothesize that these mutations may actually &amp;lsquo;collaborate&amp;rsquo; with known oncogenes in the genesis of tumors through their interactions.</description>

      <title>Why Short-Order Bioinformatics Doesn&#39;t Work</title>
      <link>/2015/11/24/short-order-bioinformatics/</link>

      <guid>/2015/11/24/short-order-bioinformatics/</guid>
      <description>Unfortunately, many researchers look at computational biology and bioinformatics as a black-box: you put in data, and you get results out. The bioinformaticians and computational biologists are seen as mostly computer operators who push the button and not as true collaborators. One of my co-workers calls this &amp;ldquo;short-order&amp;rdquo; bioinformatics.
There is great danger in simply pushing a button to get results. One type of analysis, Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) is highly dependent on how mutations are incorporated into a gene set.</description>

      <title>Interesting interview with the developer of statcheck</title>
      <link>/2015/11/19/statcheck-package/</link>

      <description>Due to the usual postdoc busy-ness, I haven&amp;rsquo;t had the energy to update this blog as much as I would like, but I thought this interview on Retraction Watch from Michèle B. Nuijten, the developer of the R-package statcheck to be fascinating. Her package essentially automates the checking of p-values given published data in papers, from converting the papers from pdf to text, and sees if the calculated p-values are correct.</description>

      <title>Somatic Mutations in Skin Paper</title>
      <link>/2015/05/26/mutational-burden-in-skin/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 26 May 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>/2015/05/26/mutational-burden-in-skin/</guid>
      <description>This paper, High burden and pervasive positive selection of somatic mutations in normal human skin is fascinating. It suggests that the mutational burden is much higher than we expected in skin cells due to UV exposure. In addition, subclones exist in the skin that are positively selected for oncogenes.
It also makes me want to stock up on sunscreen.</description>

      <title>High Impact Factor Journals Have Higher Retraction Rates</title>
      <link>/2015/05/24/the-rise-of-fraud-in-high-if-journals/</link>

      <guid>/2015/05/24/the-rise-of-fraud-in-high-if-journals/</guid>
      <description>Very interesting New York Times article about the rise of frauds and retractions in High Impact Factor journals. The retraction rates for High IF journals (such as Science, Cell, and Nature) are much higher than lower IF journals.
From the article:
 Journals with higher impact factors retract papers more often than those with lower impact factors. It’s not clear why. It could be that these prominent periodicals have more, and more careful, readers, who notice mistakes.</description>
